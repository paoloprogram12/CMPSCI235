// Write a C++ program that reads a list of double-precision grades from
// the key- board into an array named grade. The grades are to be counted
// as they’re read, and entry is to be terminated when a negative value has 
// been entered. After all grades have been input, your program should find 
// and display the sum and average of the grades. The grades should then be 
// listed with an asterisk (*) placed in front of each grade that’s below the average.
// b. Extend the program written for Exercise 1a to display each grade and its 
// letter equivalent, using the following scale:
// Between 90 and 100 = A
// Greater than or equal to 80 and less than 90 = B 
// Greater than or equal to 70 and less than 80 = C 
// Greater than or equal to 60 and less than 70 = D 
// Less than 60 = F

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {

    double grade[0];

    return 0;
